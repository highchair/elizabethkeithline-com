The Washington Center of ADA University is pleased to present Forward Seasons by artists Chong Kang and Elizabeth Keithline. The exhibition will run from January 15 through April 16, 2026. The ADA Gallery participates in 1st Friday and 3rd Thursday events from 6 to 8 pm and is open by appointment by emailing lr@adawdc.org.

Kang and Keithline paint contemporary abstract environments using color and composition to mirror the joy, energy and movement of contemporary life. From the caves of Lascaux, to the cathedrals of Rome, to the post-war Abstract Expressionist movement, art is often created as a reaction to the time in which it is made. Contemporary art continues to express current circumstances—in this case, the noise and chaos of the 21st century.
