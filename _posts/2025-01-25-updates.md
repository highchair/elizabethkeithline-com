I’m honored to be in a [littlebitcreates video for inside + out](https://insideandoutupstateny.com/upstate-art-culture/in-the-studio-with-artist-elizabeth-keithline/). I really appreciate our friends Mimi Young & Richard Hall. If you're looking for video production, they do great work.

I'm also in the following shows this winter. I hope you'll come to the openings if you're nearby.

I have 2 pieces in _Your Pick_, curated by the great Tara Foley and Laurie De Chiara at [ArtYard, 80 Smith Street, Kingston, NY](https://artportkingston.org/artyard). There is a closing event this Saturday, January 25 from 3-5 pm.

I will have a 9' x 7' site-specific installation inside a [Bank Art Gallery](https://www.bankartgallery.com/) vault in _Expressions In Every Form_, curated by director Shirley Noto, opening on Friday, February 7 at 6 pm. The gallery is located at 94 Broadway, Newburgh, NY. The show runs through March 30. Gallery hours are Fridays 4-8 and Saturdays and Sundays 12-5.

A group show that I juried, _You're Breaking Up_, and my conceptually linked solo show _Breaking Broken_ will be exhibited at [Unison Arts, 9 Paradies Lane, New Paltz, NY](https://www.unisonarts.org/) February 1 - March 8. There will be an opening event on Saturday, February 8 from 4-6 pm. Both shows explore what it means to break—and how we find meaning in the aftermath.
