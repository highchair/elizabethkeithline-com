Made In The Shade, a public art project by artist Elizabeth Keithline, opening August 27 – October 22, 2023. This exhibition is presented in coordination with Old Stone House and NYC Parks’ Art in the Parks program. The public is invited to attend a free opening event on Sunday, August 27, 4-6 pm.

_Ten year old Eldon was in Washington Park underneath some climbing bars. He was concentrating on tracing the shadow of the bars onto a wood panel, but the shadow kept moving and he had to rush to capture it. He turned and looked up at the sky. What was the sun doing up there anyway?_

In a warming world, shade has become a valued commodity. Made In The Shade is a public art tribute to the parks and green spaces that allow people to gather, cool off, play and relax. Artist Elizabeth Keithline recently asked Eldon and other park goers to consider the value of New York City public parks as providers of shade by tracing the shadows of some of their favorite things on 2' x 4' wood panels: playground equipment, a bike, an ice cream cart, a tree. Those painted panels will hang on 3rd Street between 4th and 5th Avenues along the Washington Park turf field fence. The installation can be viewed 24 hours a day from August 27 through October 22, 2023.
