I’m excited and pleased to announce that [Chashama](https://chashama.org){:target="_blank"} has awarded my work a solo show. “[Welcome Home/Shadow Home](https://chashama.org/event/welcome-home-shadow-home/){:target="_blank"}” will be open Fridays through Sundays from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm, October 21 through November 6, located at 340 East 64th Street, New York, NY. 

An opening event will be held Friday, October 28, from 5:00 to 7:00 pm with Jeff Keithline and Sal Cataldi playing wild and wiry music from 6:00 to 7:00.

Special Shadow Drawing sessions will take place each Saturday and Sunday from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. Please come and play.

There are some really good art institutions within a 30-minute walk of the gallery: MOMA, the Met Museum, Central Park’s Arsenal Gallery, the Museum of Art and Design, the Frick, the Park Avenue Armory and the Asia Society, just to name a few. There’s so much going on in the city this fall. Make a day of it!
