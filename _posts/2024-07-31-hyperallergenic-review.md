Elizabeth Keithline repurposes discarded wood to explore cast shadows and destruction, revealing moments of energetic growth as the flipside of darkness and ruin. Breaking Broken at Jane Street Art Center in Saugerties presents a series of her latest paintings in this vein: “Ocular 1” (2024), for instance, harbors jagged layers of wood nestled within a gnarly rip in a perfectly baby blue expanse. “Ruins 9” (2024) appears to be a landscape containing a sheath of ice and a ragged mountainous range of sorts, and her oversized seven-panel painting “Through Line” (2023) is a vigorous flow of lines and colors that appear to harmonize as they, too, rip across the wood on which they are painted, defying gravity as they go.
