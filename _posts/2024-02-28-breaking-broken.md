Three decades ago, artist Elizabeth Keithline pioneered a unique sculpture technique, weaving wire around large objects and burning them out. She noticed that this method sparked a ghoulish interest among observers (people really loved the large fires), highlighting a rarely explored aspect of human nature — a fascination with destruction. While society often suppresses such impulses, Keithline believes that acknowledging and understanding our destructive tendencies is essential. Through _Breaking Broken_, she endeavors to confront the multifaceted nature of destruction.

Notably, Keithline employs found paint and wood, embracing imperfection and repurposing discarded materials. The pieces she will exhibit in Breaking Broken have all undergone some
aspect of destruction under her hand. 

In concert with her solo exhibition, Keithline will jury _You’re Breaking Up_, a national call for entries that focus on the topic of destruction. The exhibition will be shown at The Sketchbook Gallery, 9 Jane Street, Saugerties, NY from Sep 7 — Sep 28, 2024, with an opening reception Sep 7 from 4-7 pm.

The call for _You’re Breaking Up_ will run from May 10 — June 1, 2024. To apply, [use our online Jotform](//form.jotform.com/241294770178160).
