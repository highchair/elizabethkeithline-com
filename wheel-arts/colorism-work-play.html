      <p class="u__rhythm"><i>Color-ism</i>, by St. Louis artists Danielle and Kevin McCoy, aka WORK/PLAY, was installed in the Weil Gallery at Wheaton College, Norton, MA from January 24 through February 23, 2018. </p>
      <p>WORK/PLAY is an interdisciplinary design duo based in St. Louis, MO. Kevin received a BFA in Graphic Communication from the University of Missouri St. Louis and recently earned an MFA from Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts, Washington University in St. Louis. Danielle is a conceptual artist, writer, and educator. Together, they combine illustration, minimal contemporary design along with experimental printmaking techniques into their art practice. With their use of design and printmaking, the collaborative duo has expanded their practice to textile arts, site-specific installation, publications and bookmaking to deliver an acerbic dose of revelation to inspire audiences and trigger experiences. They continuously experiment with new techniques, seeking to push beyond the perceived boundaries of art, design and printmaking. </p>
